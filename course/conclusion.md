# Conclusion


By now, you are a professional OpenAPI user!  
... or at least you now the basics.


I hope you liked this course and could learn something about OpenAPI.
In the upcoming lab session, we will have a closer look at some of the Swagger tools and create our own API.

## What's next?

- Lab session on **22nd of November**
- Play around with the [Petstore API](https://petstore3.swagger.io/) example of Swagger if you want
